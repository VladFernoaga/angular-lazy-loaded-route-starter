# Two level master - detail navigation using Angular children routes

## Description

This project is a sample Angular application that demonstrates how a two layer deep master - detail navigation can be implemented, using Angular children routes.

## Use case

The sample application consists of a top bar and a side navigation of the left.

**Level 1 master - detail navigation**

From the side navigation by clicking on the buttons on the right side, the content page can be changed.
![Navigation level 1 ](/nav-level-1.png?raw=true "navigation level 1 ")

**Level 2 master - detail navigation**

Clicking the show details button in the detail page opens a detail view on the right side, within that current content page.
![Navigation level 2 ](/nav-level-2.png?raw=true "navigation level 2 ")
